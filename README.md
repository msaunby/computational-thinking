## Computational thinking is problem solving, and system design

What sorts of problems can computational thinking solve?

### Real examples of how computer systems are designed

## Abstractions, models, theories, algorithms, and simulations

Computer programmers, and therefore computer scientists, use models (or abstractions) so much that aspects of these models are a part of their everyday language.  Programmers use the term "layer" to refer to a part of a software system, because these systems are conceptually formed from layers of software, rather like courses of bricks in a wall.  This then leads to terms like "stack" meaning multiple layers of software, and even to programmers refering to themselves as "full stack", meaning they know how to program all the layers.

Who’s worth more, a Frontend, Backend or Fullstack web developer?
