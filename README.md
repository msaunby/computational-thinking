# [Computational Thinking](https://msaunby.github.io/computational-thinking/)

## Purpose of this website

I'm [Michael Saunby](https://http://www.saunby.net/about/), and in 2019 I helped deliver the IoC Summer School at the University of Exeter, where we introduced 30 undergraduate and post-grad students from non-STEM subjects to programming, data science and machine learning. Subsequently I was asked to give a lecture on programming to student teachers, again from non-STEM backgrounds.  The material on this website is intended to support that lecture.

Note: I've selected segments of the YouTube videos on this page to show in my lecture.  I recommend you watch these clips, but I also encourage watching the entire videos when you have a chance.  This material is not intended for teaching, rather it is to help understand how people working with computer software understand their relationship with software.  Some of the language they use may be unfamiliar, perhaps even impenetrable, please don't worry about that, it's not my intention these clips be fully understood, only that they give an insight into software development and the people who do it.

## What is Computational thinking?

### Computational thinking, 10 years later

In 2016 Jeannette Wing reflected on her 2006 call to computer science professors to teach “Ways to Think Like a Computer Scientist”

## Computational thinking is problem solving, and system design

What sorts of problems can computational thinking solve? Our first thoughts on this might be to think of computers being used to solve really difficult problems in science and engineering, and that certainly happens, my own background is in developing software for analysing satellite imagery and understanding climate change, however there are plenty of tricky problems to be solved with computers much closer to home.  Here are a couple of examples from some household names - Google and Netflix.

### Real examples of how computer systems are designed

#### Paper prototyping

  This tutorial shows how a skill familiar to everyone, sketching, is used in a disciplined way to design software.

Google's Mariam Shaikh and Melissa Powel talk about sketching and paper prototyping.

#### Testing at Netflix

 This talk is very technical, but delivered really well. It's a great example of how people working with software embrace difficult problems and find new ways of using the knowledge they have to create even more knowledge about the complex computer systems they and their colleagues are building.

## Abstractions, models, theories, algorithms, and simulations

All these terms were mentioned by Jeannette Wing in her talk on Computational thinking.  I'll not define these terms here, in any case they tend to overlap, and there are even more terms that computer scientists and engineers use - patterns, objects, frameworks, collections, data types, all immediately come to my mind.

Computer programmers, and computer scientists, use models so much that aspects of these models are a part of their everyday language.  For example, programmers use the term "layer" to refer to a part of a software system, because these systems are conceptually formed from layers of software, rather like courses of bricks in a wall.  This then leads to terms like "stack" meaning multiple layers of software, and even to programmers referring to themselves as "full stack", meaning they know how to program all the layers.

#### Who’s worth more, a Frontend, Backend or Fullstack web developer?

Many young programmers (coders, developers, software engineers) are teaching themselves and each other. They use blogs, video, podcasts, forums, etc. to share what they are learning.
